# Gravity-Based 3D Platformer (Unreal Engine + GAS)

## Overview
This project is a gravity-based 3D platformer built in Unreal Engine, utilizing the **Gameplay Abilities System (GAS)** for advanced character abilities. The game features dynamic gravity mechanics, movement-based platforming, and special abilities that enhance traversal and gameplay depth.

## Features
- **Gravity Manipulation:** Players can alter gravity to navigate challenging platforming sections.
- **GAS-Driven Abilities:** Includes jump enhancements, flying mechanics, and directional gravity shifts.
- **Enhanced Input System:** Uses the **Enhanced Input** plugin for flexible and responsive controls.
- **Third-Person Camera System:** Dynamic camera control using a **Spring Arm Component**.
- **Smooth Character Movement:** Configured via **CharacterMovementComponent** for precise control.

## Key Technologies
- **Unreal Engine 5**
- **C++ for Core Gameplay & GAS Integration**
- **Blueprints for Rapid Prototyping**
- **Gameplay Abilities System (GAS)**
- **Enhanced Input System**

## Future Plans
- Implement additional gravity-based abilities.
- Add AI-driven obstacles and dynamic level interactions.
- Expand player movement mechanics with wall-running and air-dashing.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in **Unreal Engine 5**.
3. Ensure **Enhanced Input** and **Gameplay Abilities System (GAS)** are enabled.
4. Compile the project and start playing!
